Running Keystone in HTTPD
=========================


SSL
===

To run Keystone in HTTPD, first enable SSL support.  This is optional,  but highly recommended.

Install mod_nss according to your distribution, then apply the following patch and restart HTTPD::

Firewall
--------

Add the following rule to IPTables in order to ensure the SSL traffic can pass your firewall::

    -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

it goes right before::

    -A INPUT -j REJECT --reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

Files
-----

Copy the file httpd/wsgi-keystone.conf to the appropriate location for your apache server, most likely::

    /etc/httpd/conf.d/wsgi-keystone.conf

Create the directory ``/var/www/cgi-bin/keystone/``. You can either hardlink or softlink the files ``main`` and ``admin`` to the file ``keystone.py`` in this directory.  For a distribution appropriate place, it should probably be copied to::

    /usr/share/openstack/keystone/httpd/keystone.py

Keystone's primary configuration file (``etc/keystone.conf``) and the PasteDeploy
configuration file (``etc/keystone-paste.ini``) must be readable to HTTPD in
one of the default locations described in :doc:`configuration`.

SELinux
-------

If you are running with SELinux enabled (and you should be) make sure that the file has the appropriate SELinux context to access the linked file.  If you have the file in /var/www/cgi-bin,  you can do this by running::

    sudo restorecon /var/www/cgi-bin

Putting it somewhere else requires you set up your SELinux policy accordingly.

Keystone Configuration
----------------------

Make sure you use either the ``SQL`` or the ``memcached`` driver for ``tokens``, otherwise the tokens will not be shared between the processes of the Apache HTTPD server.

For ``SQL,`` in ``/etc/keystone/keystone.conf`` make sure you have set::

    [token]
    driver = keystone.token.backends.sql.Token

For ``memcache,`` in ``/etc/keystone/keystone.conf`` make sure you have set::

    [token]
    driver = keystone.token.backends.memcache.Token

In both cases,  all servers that are storing tokens need a shared backend.  This means either that both point
to the same database server, or both point to a common memcached instance.
