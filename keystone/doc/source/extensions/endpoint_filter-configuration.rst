Enabling Endpoint Filter Extension
==================================

To enable the endpoint filter extension:

1. add the endpoint filter extension catalog driver to the ``[catalog]`` section
   in ``keystone.conf``. example::

    [catalog]
    driver = keystone.contrib.endpoint_filter.backends.catalog_sql.EndpointFilterCatalog

2. add the ``endpoint_filter_extension`` filter to the ``api_v3`` pipeline in
   ``keystone-paste.ini``. example::

    [pipeline:api_v3]
    pipeline = access_log sizelimit url_normalize token_auth admin_token_auth xml_body json_body ec2_extension s3_extension endpoint_filter_extension service_v3

3. create the endpoint filter extension tables if using the provided sql backend. example::

    ./bin/keystone-manage db_sync --extension endpoint_filter

4. optional: change ``return_all_endpoints_if_no_filter`` the ``[endpoint_filter]`` section
   in ``keystone.conf`` to return an empty catalog if no associations are made. example::

    [endpoint_filter]
    return_all_endpoints_if_no_filter = False
