Middleware Architecture
=======================

Abstract
========

The Keystone middleware architecture supports a common authentication protocol
in use between the OpenStack projects. By using Keystone as a common
authentication and authorization mechanism, the OpenStack project can plug in
to existing authentication and authorization systems in use by existing
environments.

The auth_token middleware is no longer hosted in Keystone and has moved to the
python-keystoneclient project. The `documentation regarding authentication
middleware`_ can be found there.
