    This state machine can be used to automatically run a given set of

    on_enter and on_exit callback can also be provided which will be called to
    perform some type of action on leaving a prior state and before entering a
    new state.

    NOTE(harlowja): reactions will *only* be called when the generator/iterator
    from run_iter() does *not* send back a new event (they will always be
    called if the run() method is used). This allows for two unique ways (these
    ways can also be intermixed) to use this state machine when using
    run_iter(); one where *external* events trigger the next state transition
    and one where *internal* reaction callbacks trigger the next state
    transition. The other way to use this state machine is to skip using run()
    or run_iter() completely and use the process_event() method explicitly and
    trigger the events via some *external* functionality.
