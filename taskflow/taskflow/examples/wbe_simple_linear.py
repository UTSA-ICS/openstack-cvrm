# INTRO: This example walks through a miniature workflow which shows how to
# start up a number of workers (these workers will process task execution and
# reversion requests using any provided input data) and then use an engine
# that creates a set of *capable* tasks and flows (the engine can not create
# tasks that the workers are not able to run, this will end in failure) that
# those workers will run and then executes that workflow seamlessly using the
# workers to perform the actual execution.
#
# NOTE(harlowja): this example simulates the expected larger number of workers
# by using a set of threads (which in this example simulate the remote workers
# that would typically be running on other external machines).

# A filesystem can also be used as the queue transport (useful as simple
# transport type that does not involve setting up a larger mq system). If this
# is false then the memory transport is used instead, both work in standalone
# setups.
