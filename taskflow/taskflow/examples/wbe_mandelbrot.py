# INTRO: This example walks through a workflow that will in parallel compute
# a mandelbrot result set (using X 'remote' workers) and then combine their
# results together to form a final mandelbrot fractal image. It shows a usage
# of taskflow to perform a well-known embarrassingly parallel problem that has
# the added benefit of also being an elegant visualization.
#
# NOTE(harlowja): this example simulates the expected larger number of workers
# by using a set of threads (which in this example simulate the remote workers
# that would typically be running on other external machines).
#
# NOTE(harlowja): to have it produce an image run (after installing pillow):
