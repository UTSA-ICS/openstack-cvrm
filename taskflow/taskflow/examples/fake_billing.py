# activation (which invokes a 'fake' webservice) and final completion.

# This example also shows how a function/object (in this class the url sending)
# that occurs during driver activation can update the progress of a task
# without being aware of the internals of how to do this by associating a
# callback that the url sending can update as the sending progresses from 0.0%
# complete to 100% complete.
