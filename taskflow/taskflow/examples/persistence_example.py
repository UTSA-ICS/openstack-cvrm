# INTRO: In this example we create two tasks, one that will say hi and one
# that will say bye with optional capability to raise an error while
# executing. During execution if a later task fails, the reverting that will
# occur in the hi task will undo this (in a ~funny~ way).
#
# To also show the effect of task persistence we create a temporary database
# that will track the state transitions of this hi + bye workflow, this
# persistence allows for you to examine what is stored (using a sqlite client)
# as well as shows you what happens during reversion and what happens to
# the database during both of these modes (failing or not failing).
