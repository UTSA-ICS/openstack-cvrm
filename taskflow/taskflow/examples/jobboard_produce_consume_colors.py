# In this example we show how a jobboard can be used to post work for other
# entities to work on. This example creates a set of jobs using one producer
# thread (typically this would be split across many machines) and then having
# other worker threads with there own jobboards select work using a given
# filters [red/blue] and then perform that work (and consuming or abandoning
# the job after it has been completed or failed).

# Things to note:
# - No persistence layer is used (or logbook), just the job details are used
#   to determine if a job should be selected by a worker or not.
# - This example runs in a single process (this is expected to be atypical
#   but this example shows that it can be done if needed, for testing...)
# - The iterjobs(), claim(), consume()/abandon() worker workflow.
# - The post() producer workflow.
