# INTRO: This examples shows how a linear flow and a unordered flow can be
# used together to execute calculations in parallel and then use the
# result for the next task/s. The adder task is used for all calculations
# and argument bindings are used to set correct parameters for each task.


# This task provides some values from as a result of execution, this can be
# useful when you want to provide values from a static set to other tasks that
# depend on those values existing before those tasks can run.
#
# NOTE(harlowja): this usage is *depreciated* in favor of a simpler mechanism
# that provides those values on engine running by prepopulating the storage
# backend before your tasks are ran (which accomplishes a similar goal in a
# more uniform manner).
