    A flow is a structure that defines relationships between tasks. You can
    add tasks and other flows (as subflows) to the flow, and the flow provides
    a way to implicitly or explicitly define how they are interdependent.
    Exact structure of the relationships is defined by concrete
    implementation, while this class defines common interface and adds
    human-readable (not necessary unique) name.

    NOTE(harlowja): if a flow is placed in another flow as a subflow, a desired
    way to compose flows together, then it is valid and permissible that during
    compilation the subflow & parent flow *may* be flattened into a new flow.
