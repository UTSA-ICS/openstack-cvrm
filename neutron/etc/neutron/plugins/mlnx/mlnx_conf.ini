# (StrOpt) Type of network to allocate for tenant networks. The

# Example: tenant_network_type = vlan

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>[:<vlan_min>:<vlan_max>] tuples enumerating ranges
# of VLAN IDs on named physical networks that are available for
# allocation. All physical networks listed are available for flat and
# VLAN provider network creation. Specified ranges of VLAN IDs are

# Example: network_vlan_ranges = default:1:100

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
# <physical_network>:<physical_network_type>  tuples mapping physical
# network names to physical network types. All physical
# networks listed in network_vlan_ranges should have
# mappings to appropriate physical network type.
# Type of the physical network can be either eth (Ethernet) or

# (ListOpt) Comma-separated list of
