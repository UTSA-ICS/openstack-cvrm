# Defines configuration options specific for Arista ML2 Mechanism driver

[ml2_arista]
# (StrOpt) EOS IP address. This is required field. If not set, all
#          communications to Arista EOS will fail
#
# eapi_host =
# Example: eapi_host = 192.168.0.1
#
# (StrOpt) EOS command API username. This is required field.
#          if not set, all communications to Arista EOS will fail.
#
# eapi_username =
# Example: arista_eapi_username = admin
#
# (StrOpt) EOS command API password. This is required field.
#          if not set, all communications to Arista EOS will fail.
#
# eapi_password =
# Example: eapi_password = my_password
#
# (StrOpt) Defines if hostnames are sent to Arista EOS as FQDNs
#          ("node1.domain.com") or as short names ("node1"). This is
#          optional. If not set, a value of "True" is assumed.

# (IntOpt) Sync interval in seconds between Neutron plugin and EOS.
#          This field defines how often the synchronization is performed.

#
# (StrOpt) Defines Region Name that is assigned to this OpenStack Controller.
#          This is useful when multiple OpenStack/Neutron controllers are
#          managing the same Arista HW clusters. Note that this name must
#          match with the region name registered (or known) to keystone
#          service. Authentication with Keysotne is performed by EOS.
#          This is optional. If not set, a value of "RegionOne" is assumed.
