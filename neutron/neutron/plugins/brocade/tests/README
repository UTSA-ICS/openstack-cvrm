     2. Associates the MAC address with the created port-profile

          (after running check that PP is created on the switch)

        % noscli.py delete <network>
          (after running check that PP is deleted from the switch)

        % noscli.py associate <network> <mac>
          (after running check that MAC is associated with PP)
