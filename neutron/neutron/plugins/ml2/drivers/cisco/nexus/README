Neutron ML2 Cisco Nexus Mechanism Driver README


Notes:

The initial version of this driver supports only a single physical
network.

For provider networks, extended configuration options are not
currently supported.

This driver's database may have duplicate entries also found in the
core ML2 database. Since the Cisco Nexus DB code is a port from the
plugins/cisco implementation this duplication will remain until the
plugins/cisco code is deprecated.
