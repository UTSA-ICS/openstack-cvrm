- Usage
neutron-debug commands

probe-create <net-id>
  Create probe port - create port and interface, then plug it in.
  This commands returns a port id of a probe port. A probe port is a port which is used to test.
  The port id is probe id.
  We can have multiple probe probes in a network, in order to check connectivity between ports.

  neutron-debug probe-exec probe_id_1 'nc -l 192.168.100.3 22'
  neutron-debug probe-exec probe_id_2 'nc -vz 192.168.100.4 22'

  Note: You should use a user and a tenant who has permission to
   modify network and subnet if you want to probe. For example, you need to be admin user if you
   want to probe external network.

probe-delete <port-id>  Delete probe - delete port then uplug
probe-exec <port-id> 'command'    Exec commands on the namespace of the probe
`probe-exec <port-id>` 'interactive command' Exec interactive command (eg, ssh)

probe-list     List probes
probe-clear    Clear All probes

ping-all --id <network_id> --timeout 1 (optional)
         ping-all is all-in-one command to ping all fixed ip's in all network or a specified network.
         In the command probe is automatically created if needed.

neutron-debug extends the shell of neutronclient,  so you can use all the commands of neutron
