# TODO(kgiusti) AMQP 1.0 support depends on the Qpid Proton AMQP 1.0
# development libraries.  As these are not yet available from the
# Ubuntu repositories, do not require these packages by default.  If
# you have installed the Proton development libraries, you can run the
# amqp1 driver tox tests this way:
#    tox -e amqp1
pyngus>=1.0.0,<2.0.0  # Apache-2.0
python-qpid-proton>=0.7,<0.8  # Apache-2.0
