Controller that manages the interface between the driver and the messaging
service.

This module defines a Controller class that is responsible for performing
messaging-related operations (Tasks) requested by the driver, and for managing
the connection to the messaging service.  The Controller creates a background
thread which performs all messaging operations and socket I/O.  The
Controller's messaging logic is executed in the background thread via lambda
functions scheduled by the Controller.
