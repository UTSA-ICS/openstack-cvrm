"""
An RPC server exposes a number of endpoints, each of which contain a set of
methods which may be invoked remotely by clients over a given transport.

To create an RPC server, you supply a transport, target and a list of
endpoints.

A transport can be obtained simply by calling the get_transport() method::

    transport = messaging.get_transport(conf)

which will load the appropriate transport driver according to the user's
messaging configuration configuration. See get_transport() for more details.

The target supplied when creating an RPC server expresses the topic, server
name and - optionally - the exchange to listen on. See Target for more details
on these attributes.

Each endpoint object may have a target attribute which may have namespace and
version fields set. By default, we use the 'null namespace' and version 1.0.
Incoming method calls will be dispatched to the first endpoint with the
requested method, a matching namespace and a compatible version number.

RPC servers have start(), stop() and wait() messages to begin handling
requests, stop handling requests and wait for all in-process requests to
complete.

A simple example of an RPC server with multiple endpoints might be::

    from oslo.config import cfg
    from oslo import messaging

    class ServerControlEndpoint(object):

        target = messaging.Target(namespace='control',
                                  version='2.0')

        def __init__(self, server):
            self.server = server

        def stop(self, ctx):
            if server:
                self.server.stop()

    class TestEndpoint(object):

        def test(self, ctx, arg):
            return arg

    transport = messaging.get_transport(cfg.CONF)
    target = messaging.Target(topic='test', server='server1')
    endpoints = [
        ServerControlEndpoint(None),
        TestEndpoint(),
    ]
    server = messaging.get_rpc_server(transport, target, endpoints,
                                      executor='blocking')
    server.start()
    server.wait()

Clients can invoke methods on the server by sending the request to a topic and
it gets sent to one of the servers listening on the topic, or by sending the
request to a specific server listening on the topic, or by sending the request
to all servers listening on the topic (known as fanout). These modes are chosen
via the server and fanout attributes on Target but the mode used is transparent
to the server.

The first parameter to method invocations is always the request context
supplied by the client.

Parameters to the method invocation are primitive types and so must be the
return values from the methods. By supplying a serializer object, a server can
deserialize a request context and arguments from - and serialize return values
to - primitive types.
