Python bindings to the OpenStack Images API
=============================================

This is a client library for Glance built on the OpenStack Images API. It provides a Python API (the ``glanceclient`` module) and a command-line tool (``glance``). This library fully supports the v1 Images API, while support for the v2 API is in progress.

Development takes place via the usual OpenStack processes as outlined in the `OpenStack wiki <http://wiki.openstack.org/HowToContribute>`_.  The master repository is on `GitHub <http://github.com/openstack/python-glanceclient>`_.

See release notes and more at `<http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-glanceclient/>`_.
