OpenStack Nova Documentation README
===================================
Included documents:

- developer reference guide(devref)
- man pages

Dependencies
------------
Building this documentation can be done in a regular Nova development
environment, such as the virtualenv created by ``run_tests.sh`` or
``tools/install_venv.py``.  A leaner but sufficient environment can be
created by starting with one that is suitable for running Nova (such
as the one created by DevStack) and then using pip to install
oslosphinx.

Building the docs
-----------------
From the root nova directory::

  python setup.py build_sphinx

Building just the man pages
---------------------------
from the root nova directory::

  python setup.py build_sphinx -b man


Installing the man pages
-------------------------
After building the man pages, they can be found in ``doc/build/man/``.
You can install the man page onto your system by following the following steps:

Example for ``nova-scheduler``::

  mkdir /usr/local/man/man1
  install -g 0 -o 0 -m 0644 doc/build/man/nova-scheduler.1  /usr/local/man/man1/nova-scheduler.1
  gzip /usr/local/man/man1/nova-scheduler.1
  man nova-scheduler
