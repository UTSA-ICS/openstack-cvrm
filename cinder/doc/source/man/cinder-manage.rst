SYNOPSIS
========

  cinder-manage <category> <action> [<args>]

DESCRIPTION
===========

cinder-manage provides control of cinder database migration, and provides an interface to get information about the current state of cinder.  More information about OpenStack Cinder is available at http://cinder.openstack.org.

OPTIONS
=======

The standard pattern for executing a cinder-manage command is:
``cinder-manage <category> <command> [<args>]``

For example, to obtain a list of the cinder services currently running:
``cinder-manage service list``

Run without arguments to see a list of available command categories:
``cinder-manage``

Categories are shell, logs, migrate, db, volume, host, service, backup, version, sm and config. Detailed descriptions are below.

You can also run with a category argument such as 'db' to see a list of all commands in that category:
``cinder-manage db``

These sections describe the available categories and arguments for cinder-manage.
