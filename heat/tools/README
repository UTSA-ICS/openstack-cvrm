Files in this directory are general developer tools or examples of how
to do certain activities.

If you're running on F16, make sure you first enable the preview yum repository

Tools
-----

+ experimental_ssh_eventlet.py
     - Example of using ssh inside python with eventlets.

+ openstack - WARNING COULD DESTROY DATA
    - Installs, Uninstalls, starts, and stops openstack from the RPM repository
      on F16 or F17.  This provides a consistent way for developers to deploy
      openstack in a consistent painless way.

      THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR END USERS AS IT COULD PERMANENTLY DESTROY DATA
      AND DOES NOT PROPERLY SECURE THE INSTALLATION.

      note: This tool does not create a network.  Creating a network depends
            on the specific environment, but an example network creation:

sudo nova-manage network create demonet 10.0.0.0/24 1 256 --bridge=demonetbr0

+ heat-keystone-setup
    - This tool configures keystone for use with the heat service  the first
       time openstack is installed.

+ heat-db-drop
    - This script drops the heat database from mysql in the case of developer
      data corruption or erasing heat.

+ glance-jeos-add-from-github.sh
    - Register all JEOS images from github prebuilt repositories.
      This takes about 1 hour on a typical wireless connection.
