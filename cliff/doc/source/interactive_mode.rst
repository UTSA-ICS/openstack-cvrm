==================
 Interactive Mode
==================

In addition to running single commands from the command line, cliff
supports an interactive mode in which the user is presented with a
separate command shell. All of the command plugins available from the
command line are automatically configured as commands within the
shell.

Refer to the cmd2_ documentation for more details about features of
the shell.

.. _cmd2: http://packages.python.org/cmd2/index.html

Example
=======

The ``cliffdemo`` application enters interactive mode if no command is
specified on the command line.

::

    (.venv)$ cliffdemo
    (cliffdemo) help
    
    Shell commands (type help <topic>):
    ===================================
    cmdenvironment  edit  hi       l   list  pause  r    save  shell      show
    ed              help  history  li  load  py     run  set   shortcuts
    
    Undocumented commands:
    ======================
    EOF  eof  exit  q  quit
    
    Application commands (type help <topic>):
    =========================================
    files  help  simple  file  error  two part

To obtain instructions for a built-in or application command, use the
``help`` command:

::
    
    (cliffdemo) help simple
    usage: simple [-h]
    
    A simple command that prints a message.
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit

The commands can be run, including options and arguments, as on the
regular command line:

::
    
    (cliffdemo) simple
    sending greeting
    hi!
    (cliffdemo) files
